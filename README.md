# FT_helperfunctions

Some functions that may be helpful to process M/EEG data with the MATLAB toolbox Fieldtrip (http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/).

pm_computeAvgRef: computes average reference for M/EEG data in a Fieldtrip data structure format.

pm_computeGFP: computes Global Field Power, the spatial standard deviation of voltage values over all electrodes at a given timepoint, for M/EEG data in a Fieldtrip data format.
